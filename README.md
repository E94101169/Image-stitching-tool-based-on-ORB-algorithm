# This is a image-stitching-tool-based-on-ORB-algorithm

# If you execute a program named "ORB.ipynb". Please make sure to put both images in the same archive and name them "image1" and "image2"

# A file named ORB.ipynb combined with a simple user interface allows you to upload two images that you want to stitch together. Or you can use the sample images in the "IMAGE" folder
